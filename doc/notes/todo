============================================================= TODO stuff ==========================================================
- Phase 2:
    - on hold / blocked
        - Waiting for PCB
            - OSC and waveshaper PCBs
                - test clearance and airwire errors on both desings
                - build and test boards
                - circuit snapshot image and board pictures
            - clock gen
                - Need to fix bad LED cathode connection
                - build and test boards
                - circuit snapshot image and board pictures
            - Sequencer
                - build and test boards
                - circuit snapshot image and board pictures
        - Waiting for stuff from digikey 
            - VCA
                - breadboard test
                    - Need to convert to bipolar before entering? and before exiting?
                    - test knob, and test CV with LFO
                - send to Fab
                - build and test boards
                - circuit snapshot image and board pictures

            - midi2CV
                - software
                    receive midi from din5
                    send pitch to DACs
                    Save/load config from eeprom
                - breadboard test
                - send to Fab
                - build and test boards
                - circuit snapshot image and board pictures
            

- Phase 3
    - ADSR
        - pro-mini with 12bit dac
        - design
            4 knob inputs
            1 analog output (DAC) for envelope
            1 gate input
            gate to trigger converter (in software)
    - VCF
    - drum machine

============================================================= Improvements ==========================================================
- Improvements
    - How to add more voices to oscillator? with chorus? use more oscillators?
    - LFO: add a sawtooth opamp (with diodes) and allow to choose output with a switch. The gain will be kept at the end
        but I need more variable resistors so knob wont work.
    - atmega software for osc:
        need to remove noise from ADC:
            with software, filter out any changes that happen faster than 20hz. So only use an average value taken over 50ms
    - LFO: be able to control frequency with CV. But we need to also control the waveshapper

============================================================= Shopping list ==========================================================
- digikey
    toggle buttons (ordered, aliexpress)

    bus bars
    lm386
    transistors
