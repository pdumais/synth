============================================================= TODO stuff ==========================================================
- Phase 2:
    - Waiting for OSC and waveshaper PCBs
        - test clearance and airwire errors on both desings
        - build and test boards
        - circuit snapshot image and board pictures

    - Sequencer
        - Design
            PCB layout
        - Test on breadboard
        - Send PCB to fab
        - build and test boards
        - circuit snapshot image and board pictures

    - clock gen
        - Design
            clock: attiny44(already have one)
            2 outputs: at clock speed, The other 8 times faster. 
            display: 
                3 digits and 3 CD4056 (or 4511). Would need 7 pins total
            rotary encoder: PEC11R-4220F-S0012-ND
            ic pins
                2 pins for encoder
                7 digital out for display
                2 PWM output
                1 LED 
            2 Terminal for output
        - attiny code
            toggle pin with software instead of PWM
                Max freq would be 4hz(240bpm), so 32hz for the x8
            save settings in eeprom?
        - Test on breadboard
        - Send PCB to fab
        - build and test boards
        - circuit snapshot image and board pictures

    - divider
        resistor network is bad. Just add many jumpers instead 

- Phase 3
    - VCF
        Remove DC component before passing into the filter. Then add it back after. That can be done with a unity gain opamp
        ---> Use a ready built chip such as the one on electricdruid: I already ordered some
            need to step down the voltage first. Using OPAMP? or just a voltage divider?
            need bipolar signal?
        ---> OR use vactrol? NSL-32 from digikey
        few other options:
            - build my own but find a way to control resistors with voltage
                - using digipots? need an attiny with ADC. That's a bit overkill
                - using a completely different design based on OTAs ?

    - Noise generator: Avalanche noise gen with a transistor and resistor

============================================================= Improvements ==========================================================
- Improvements
    - LFO: add a sawtooth opamp (with diodes) and allow to choose output with a switch. The gain will be kept at the end
        but I need more variable resistors so knob wont work.
    - atmega software for osc:
        need to remove noise from ADC:
            with software, filter out any changes that happen faster than 20hz. So only use an average value taken over 50ms

============================================================= Shopping list ==========================================================
- digikey
    toggle buttons
    push buttons (push-to-break momentary) for reset. 
    blue 22awg wire 100'
    ribbon cable
    bus bars

- unused parts
    2 two-channel 8bit DACs
    2 8bit port extenders
