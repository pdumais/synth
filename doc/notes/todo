============================================================= TODO stuff ==========================================================
Phase 1
    - test
        use 33uf: resistance can vary from 79 to 3.1k. 33uf would let me range from 241 to 9646

    - PCB board for wave shapper: 
        power inputs: Gnd, +5, +12, -12
            decoupling caps for lm7905: test other values
        doit pouvoir remplacer les resistances par: pots, vactrol, ou le module attiny
        add pins to be able to wire 4th opamp


- Phase 2:
    - atmega software:
        need to remove noise from ADC:
            with software, filter out any changes that happen faster than 20hz. So only use an average value taken over 50ms
    - VCF
        Remove DC component before passing into the filter. Then add it back after. That can be done with a unity gain opamp
        ---> Use a ready built chip such as the one on electricdruid: I already ordered some
            need to step down the voltage first. Using OPAMP? or just a voltage divider?
            need bipolar signal?
        ---> OR use vactrol? NSL-32 from digikey
        few other options:
            - build my own but find a way to control resistors with voltage
                - using digipots? need an attiny with ADC. That's a bit overkill
                - using a completely different design based on OTAs ?

============================================================= Improvements ==========================================================
- Improvements
    - LFO: add a sawtooth opamp (with diodes) and allow to choose output with a switch. The gain will be kept at the end
        but I need more variable resistors so knob wont work.

============================================================= Shopping list ==========================================================
- digikey
    blue 22awg wire 100'
    sockets for attiny and digipots

- unused parts
    2 two-channel 8bit DACs
    2 8bit port extenders
