============================================================= TODO stuff ==========================================================
- Phase 2:
    - Waiting for OSC and waveshaper PCBs
        - test clearance and airwire errors on both desings
        - build and test boards
        - circuit snapshot image and board pictures
    - clock gen
        - build and test boards
        - circuit snapshot image and board pictures


    - Sequencer
        - Test on breadboard
            make sure knobs are left to right when looking at digit
        - Send PCB to fab
        - build and test boards
        - circuit snapshot image and board pictures



- Phase 3
    - Noise generator: Avalanche noise gen with a transistor and resistor
        current design has a hum, and it also needs to clip the signal to -5,+5
    - VCF
        Remove DC component before passing into the filter. Then add it back after. That can be done with a unity gain opamp
        ---> Use a ready built chip such as the one on electricdruid: I already ordered some
            need to step down the voltage first. Using OPAMP? or just a voltage divider?
            need bipolar signal?
        ---> OR use vactrol? NSL-32 from digikey
        few other options:
            - build my own but find a way to control resistors with voltage
                - using digipots? need an attiny with ADC. That's a bit overkill
                - using a completely different design based on OTAs ?


============================================================= Improvements ==========================================================
- Improvements
    - How to add more voices to oscillator? with chorus? use more oscillators?
    - LFO: add a sawtooth opamp (with diodes) and allow to choose output with a switch. The gain will be kept at the end
        but I need more variable resistors so knob wont work.
    - atmega software for osc:
        need to remove noise from ADC:
            with software, filter out any changes that happen faster than 20hz. So only use an average value taken over 50ms

============================================================= Shopping list ==========================================================
- digikey
    toggle buttons
    blue 22awg wire 100'
    ribbon cable
    bus bars
    lm386
