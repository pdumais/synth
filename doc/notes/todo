============================================================= TODO stuff ==========================================================
Phase 1
    - test
        use 33uf: resistance can vary from 79 to 3.1k. 33uf would let me range from 241 to 9646


- Phase 2:
    - clock gen and sequencer
        clock: attiny44(already have one) 
            display: 
                3 digits and 3 CD4056 (or 4511). Would need 7 pins total
            rotary encoder: PEC11R-4220F-S0012-ND
            pins
                2 pins for encoder
                7 digital out for display
                1 PWM output
                1 LED
                save settings in eeprom?
            2 Terminal for output

            If I want 2 clocks: 
                can use PA0 as PWM2 but this one needs to be software controlled since we only have 1 16bit timer
                Need another pin for button to choose which clock to config:
                    how to show which one is being configured?
                    we are out of pins. So we could multiplex BCDCS1
                        BCDCS1 set to input by default, and set to output only when we need to change value
                        - if pressing button, we have a signal to change config. But this will also send a strobe to 
                          BCD1. So always output value for BCD1 by default. 
                        - There could be a conflict if turning the knob while pressing button because
                          button will strobe BCD1 but we might be trying to update another BCD at that same time
                        

        sequencer
            pending for design:
                how does 4163 control the 4017? transistor or gates?
                SPDT buttons for skipping steps: wire 3 and 5 to reset. This gives us 2,4,8 steps
                reset button
                pause button
                terminals:  
                    gate out: Terminal
                    CV out: Terminal
                    clock in. Terminal
                    reset in/out for daisychain: Pins
                    enable in/out for daisychain: Pins
                    8 potentiometers requiring 2 pins each: Pins
                        will need jumper wires on each pots
                Gate: 
            Breadboard it to test the current design
            

    - VCF
        Remove DC component before passing into the filter. Then add it back after. That can be done with a unity gain opamp
        ---> Use a ready built chip such as the one on electricdruid: I already ordered some
            need to step down the voltage first. Using OPAMP? or just a voltage divider?
            need bipolar signal?
        ---> OR use vactrol? NSL-32 from digikey
        few other options:
            - build my own but find a way to control resistors with voltage
                - using digipots? need an attiny with ADC. That's a bit overkill
                - using a completely different design based on OTAs ?


============================================================= Improvements ==========================================================
- Improvements
    - LFO: add a sawtooth opamp (with diodes) and allow to choose output with a switch. The gain will be kept at the end
        but I need more variable resistors so knob wont work.
    - atmega software:
        need to remove noise from ADC:
            with software, filter out any changes that happen faster than 20hz. So only use an average value taken over 50ms

============================================================= Shopping list ==========================================================
