============================================================= TODO stuff ==========================================================
Phase 1
    - test
        use 33uf: resistance can vary from 79 to 3.1k. 33uf would let me range from 241 to 9646


- Phase 2:
    - clock gen and sequencer
        clock: attiny44(already have one) 
            display: 
                3 digits and 3 CD4056 (or 4511). Would need 7 pins total
            rotary encoder: PEC11R-4220F-S0012-ND
            pins
                2 pins for encoder
                7 digital out for display
                1 PWM output
                1 LED
                save settings in eeprom?
            2 Terminal for output

            If I want 2 clocks: 
                can use PA0 as PWM2 but this one needs to be software controlled since we only have 1 16bit timer
                Need another pin for button to choose which clock to config:
                    how to show which one is being configured?
                    we are out of pins. So we could multiplex BCDCS1
                        BCDCS1 set to input by default, and set to output only when we need to change value
                        - if pressing button, we have a signal to change config. But this will also send a strobe to 
                          BCD1. So always output value for BCD1 by default. 
                        - There could be a conflict if turning the knob while pressing button because
                          button will strobe BCD1 but we might be trying to update another BCD at that same time
                        

        sequencer
            pending for design:
                how does 4163 control the 4017? transistor or gates?
                    convert signal from 4163 to a NOT using a transistor and 2 resistor
                        we choose if we want the plain signal or the NOT signal
                    the chosen signal needs a current gain. We will pass through either:
                        - directly on drain with MPS2907. Can handle 60mA
                        - NOT made with 2n3904: can handle up to 200mA
                        - NOT made with IRF540N mosfet
                SPDT buttons for skipping steps: wire 3 and 5 to reset. This gives us 2,4,8 steps
                reset button
                    just reset the whole board. Push button to kill power
                pause button
                    do both pins need to be high or low?
                    ENT pin of binary counter
                    EN pin of 4017

                terminals:  
                    gate out: Terminal
                    CV out: Terminal
                    8 potentiometers requiring 2 pins each: Pins
                        will need jumper wires on each pots
                Gate: 
                    how does that work ??
            Breadboard it to test the current design
            

    - VCF
        Remove DC component before passing into the filter. Then add it back after. That can be done with a unity gain opamp
        ---> Use a ready built chip such as the one on electricdruid: I already ordered some
            need to step down the voltage first. Using OPAMP? or just a voltage divider?
            need bipolar signal?
        ---> OR use vactrol? NSL-32 from digikey
        few other options:
            - build my own but find a way to control resistors with voltage
                - using digipots? need an attiny with ADC. That's a bit overkill
                - using a completely different design based on OTAs ?


============================================================= Improvements ==========================================================
- Improvements
    - LFO: add a sawtooth opamp (with diodes) and allow to choose output with a switch. The gain will be kept at the end
        but I need more variable resistors so knob wont work.
    - atmega software:
        need to remove noise from ADC:
            with software, filter out any changes that happen faster than 20hz. So only use an average value taken over 50ms

============================================================= Shopping list ==========================================================
- digikey


    
    toggle buttons
    push buttons
    blue 22awg wire 100'
    sockets for attiny and digipots
    ribbon cable
    and/nand?
    bus bars

- unused parts
    2 two-channel 8bit DACs
    2 8bit port extenders

============================================================= Notes ==========================================================


connect clk barrel and pause button to the input header
connect a on-mom push button to the "reset button" header. Or use a jumper to leave out the reset function
If not daisy-chaining to a 2nd sequencer, set jumper on pin 1&2 of "split select"
If a daisy chain is needed, connect the "daisy chain" header to the "input" header of the 2nd sequencer
TODO: connection of counter selection
