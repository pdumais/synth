============================================================= TODO stuff ==========================================================
- Phase 2:
    - clock gen and sequencer
        clock: attiny44(already have one)
            output should run 8 times faster, and each module will need to divide it. 
            display: 
                3 digits and 3 CD4056 (or 4511). Would need 7 pins total
            rotary encoder: PEC11R-4220F-S0012-ND
            pins
                2 pins for encoder
                7 digital out for display
                1 PWM output
                1 LED (divide frequency by 8)
                save settings in eeprom?
            1 Terminal for output
                        

        sequencer
            pending for design:
                change opamp to +12,-12? 
                    - This eliminates the need for the LM7905
                    - Eliminates 5V clipping because of the non-R2R output
                    - signal needs to be attenuated by the last opamp, to keep it within 5V range
                        -> NO! simulation shows that this is not an issue. Signal will stay at 5V
                    - In that case, I can remove the 2nd transistor and replace it with opamp. Since the only purpose 
                      was to have signal that would not come from the 4163 and be able to draw more current
                add clock divider circuit
                SPDT buttons for skipping steps: wire 3 and 5 to reset. This gives us 2,4,8 steps
                Remove "pause" circuitry
                terminals:  
                    gate out: Terminal
                    CV out: Terminal
                    8 potentiometers requiring 2 pins each: Pins
                        will need jumper wires on each pots
                Gate: 
                    relay clock through opamp
            Breadboard it to test the current design
            

    - VCF
        Remove DC component before passing into the filter. Then add it back after. That can be done with a unity gain opamp
        ---> Use a ready built chip such as the one on electricdruid: I already ordered some
            need to step down the voltage first. Using OPAMP? or just a voltage divider?
            need bipolar signal?
        ---> OR use vactrol? NSL-32 from digikey
        few other options:
            - build my own but find a way to control resistors with voltage
                - using digipots? need an attiny with ADC. That's a bit overkill
                - using a completely different design based on OTAs ?


============================================================= Improvements ==========================================================
- Improvements
    - LFO: add a sawtooth opamp (with diodes) and allow to choose output with a switch. The gain will be kept at the end
        but I need more variable resistors so knob wont work.
    - atmega software:
        need to remove noise from ADC:
            with software, filter out any changes that happen faster than 20hz. So only use an average value taken over 50ms

============================================================= Shopping list ==========================================================
- digikey
    toggle buttons
    push buttons (push-to-break momentary) for reset. 
    blue 22awg wire 100'
    ribbon cable
    bus bars

- unused parts
    2 two-channel 8bit DACs
    2 8bit port extenders
