============================================================= Design considerations ===========================================
    - use a unity gain amplifier in each circuits that consumes another one. This is to limit the current draw.
    - If feeding audio signal through ADC, it needs to be offset above 0V

============================================================= Future ==========================================================
- Digital platform requirements
    - design ideas
        either we do:
            - each modules has its own DAC
            - 1 ADC module, 1 DAC module. All DSP module can be connected together thru i2s and the 
                chain ends on the DAC module
    - at least 48khz sampling rate on the ADC
    - i2s DAC with breakout boards 
        16bit DAC: MAX98357A
        24bit DAC: UDA1334A

    - RAM: at 48khz, 16bit, I need 96k of RAM to hold a 1s buffer. 
        for 20ms I just need 20k

- Modules:
    - ring modulator
        - multiple designs exist. The best one seems to be with transformers
    - sample and hold

    - Noise generator: Avalanche noise gen with a transistor and resistor
        current design has a hum, and it also needs to clip the signal to -5,+5

    - Delay / flanger
        Test the V3207 delay
        create delay with ADC/DAC
            - A delay with configurable size between 1ms to 20ms. CV controlled
                - when CV is from an LFO, we effectively get a flanger
            - If using multiple delays, we can get a chorus, or multiple voices out of a VCO
            - SAMD51: 
                3.3v, so need to convert output back to 5v
                12bit dac. If 16bit is needed, use AD5686 or ADS1115
        - test with V3208D?

    - drum machine
        esp32 with 12bit DAC (or i2s DAC), or teensy 3.2 has an on-board 12bit DAC
        8 samples in RAM at all times, load different sets (banks) from flash
            button to cycle thru banks
        CV input: quantize to 3 bits to select between 8 samples
        8 buttons to play manually: 
            generates CV using resistor array, and gate using capacitor
        toggle switch for "loop-enable": loops sample as long as gate is high.
        
        get wave sample set and convert to .h
        
    - sustain pedal to Gate CV: Just need 2 resistors and a perf board. But connector does not fit on perf board

    - sampler (granular synthesis?)
        - as an input source. instead of an oscillator, playback a sound file
        - The "Sparkfun Wav Trigger"/tsunami is basically just that

    - sample and repeat (experimental)
        - also called stutter / cd skipping
        - capture a sample from input, of size configurable by CV.
        - repeat playback a number of time, configurable by CV.
        - then move on to the next sample capture
