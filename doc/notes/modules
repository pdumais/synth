============================================================= Design considerations ===========================================
    - use a unity gain amplifier in each circuits that consumes another one. This is to limit the current draw.
    - If feeding audio signal through ADC, it needs to be offset above 0V

============================================================= Future ==========================================================
- Digital platform requirements
    - at least 48khz sampling rate on the ADC
    - ADC/DAC: 12bit? or 16 bit?
        16bit DAC: MAX98357A
    - RAM: at 48khz, 16bit, I need 96k of RAM to hold a 1s buffer. 
        for 20ms I just need 20k

- Modules:
    - Noise generator
        avalanche transistor

    - ADSR and VCA:
        VCA chip
            circuit?
            ouput at at 0db 
        esp32: it has a DAC
        4 ADC for knob inputs
        1 digital input for trigger

    - Delay / flanger
        create delay with ADC/DAC
            - A delay with configurable size between 1ms to 20ms. CV controlled
                - when CV is from an LFO, we effectively get a flanger
            - If using multiple delays, we can get a chorus, or multiple voices out of a VCO
            - SAMD51: 
                3.3v, so need to convert output back to 5v
                12bit dac. If 16bit is needed, use AD5686 or ADS1115
        - test with V3208D?

    - sample and repeat (experimental)
        - capture a sample from input, of size configurable by CV.
        - repeat playback a number of time, configurable by CV.
        - then move on to the next sample capture
    - ring modulator
        - multiple designs exist. The best one seems to be with transformers

    - midi2CV 
        to be able to use midi keyboard and sofware synth
        esp32
        usb midi?
        use LCD
        select channels etc.


    - sampler (granular synthesis?)
        - as an input source. instead of an oscillator, playback a sound file
        - The "Sparkfun Wav Trigger"/tsunami is basically just that
