============================================================= Future ==========================================================
- Digital platform requirements
    - design ideas
        either we do:
            - each modules has its own DAC
            - 1 ADC module, 1 DAC module. All DSP module can be connected together thru i2s and the 
                chain ends on the DAC module
    - at least 48khz sampling rate on the ADC
    - i2s DAC with breakout boards 
        16bit DAC: MAX98357A
        24bit DAC: UDA1334A

    - RAM: at 48khz, 16bit, I need 96k of RAM to hold a 1s buffer. 
        for 20ms I just need 20k

- Modules:
    - sample and hold

    - Noise generator

    - drum machine
        analog
        
    - sustain pedal to Gate CV: Just need 2 resistors and a perf board. But connector does not fit on perf board

    - sampler (granular synthesis?)
        - as an input source. instead of an oscillator, playback a sound file
        - The "Sparkfun Wav Trigger"/tsunami is basically just that

    - sample and repeat (experimental)
        - also called stutter / cd skipping
        - capture a sample from input, of size configurable by CV.
        - repeat playback a number of time, configurable by CV.
        - then move on to the next sample capture
