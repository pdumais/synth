# Wave shaper
Converts a square wave to a triangle or sine or anything in between
Only works for LFOs (below 25hz)
Requires 4 variable resistances (4-gang potentiometer, or digipots)
    Adjusting the resistance will adjust the shape of the wave. 
    If the frequency changes, the shape needs to be reajusted everytime

# Inputs
