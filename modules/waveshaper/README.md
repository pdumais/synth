# Wave shaper
Converts a square wave to a triangle or sine or anything in between
Only works for LFOs (below 25hz)
Requires 4 variable resistances (4-gang potentiometer, or digipots)
    Adjusting the resistance will adjust the shape of the wave. 
    If the frequency changes, the shape needs to be reajusted everytime

Can work with audio unipolar signal too. Using a 1uF capacitor with a 10k pot, I we get a sine:
    at 20hz with 10 kOhms
    at 2khz with 100 Ohms
    at 10khz with 20 Ohms

# Inputs
- signal
- 4 variable resistors

# Outputs
