# Voltage Controlled Amplifier

This is based on the AS2164 ic.
    - Attenuation of 1 dB per CV mV 
    - Maximum attenuation of -100dB. Thus, max 3.3V in CV
        - There is already a 100k internal resistor? so I only need 1 resistor for the divider?
    - can operate with +12, -12 power supply
    - Required components: 30k, 500 ohm, 560pf, 100pf, 0.1uf
