This is a CV to resistance converter. It takes a CV signal of 0-5V and sets 8 digital resistors to that value

- CV input is read through a 10bit ADC but digipots are 8 bits.
- each resistor can be configured from 0 to 10k in 39 Ohm increments

- NOTE: This board has not been tested yet. Need to:
    print it and check if all component fits
    make sure pins for all chips are properly connected
